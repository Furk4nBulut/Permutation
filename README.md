# Permutations of Strings

## Overview

This project demonstrates an algorithm for generating all permutations of a given string. It is a common problem in computer science and programming, and is often used to teach recursive techniques and algorithm design.

## Objective

The goal of this project is to implement a permutation algorithm that can take a string as input and produce all possible permutations of that string. This problem is particularly useful for understanding recursion, backtracking, and combinatorial problems.

## MCBU Introduction to Programming Assignment

This project is an assignment for the "Introduction to Programming" course at MCBU. The assignment focuses on implementing and understanding the concept of permutations in programming.

## Algorithm

The algorithm used in this project is a recursive approach. It involves the following steps:

1. **Base Case:** If the string is empty or contains only one character, return the string itself as the only permutation.
2. **Recursive Case:** For each character in the string, fix the character and recursively generate permutations of the remaining characters.
3. **Combine Results:** Combine the fixed character with the permutations of the remaining characters to form the final list of permutations.


## Conclusion

This project provides a practical implementation of permutations and demonstrates fundamental programming concepts such as recursion and string manipulation. Understanding how to generate permutations is a valuable skill in various programming and algorithmic scenarios.
